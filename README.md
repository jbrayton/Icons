This is a sample project to go along with a presentation for [CocoaHeads Boston](https://www.cocoaheadsboston.org/). It is an iOS app that lets you select custom icons.

The icons all have the same shapes, but use different color combinations. Therefore it was a good opportunity to automate everything pertaining to the icon variations.

The IconFileGenerator scheme is a Mac utility that generates a set of icons based on some drawing code and a set of color combinations. It also generates Info.plist entries.

The iOS app uses asset catalog entries and Info.plist entries generated by the Mac utility. You do have to manually copy the output of the Mac utility back into the project. 

The iOS app has a collection view letting you select an icon. It’s not fancy, but it does have some nice touches:

- It uses icon sizes based on the device to match Springboard. _There may be further variations for Max-sized phones or some iPads that I did not account for._
- It uses “squircle” shapes (like a rounded rect, but slightly fancier) for borders and for highlighting the selection.
- On an iPhone there are four icons per row, just like with SpringBoard.
- The drawing code is generated by PaintCode. There are no additional PNG files, and there is no runtime resizing of images from PNG files.
